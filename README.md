## 🛠 How I Built This Project
1. **Data Gathering** – Collected and combined orders, customers, and product datasets using Excel lookups (`XLOOKUP`, `INDEX MATCH`).  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, standardized dates, and converted product codes to full names.  
3. **Data Transformation** – Built Excel Tables and applied logic-based formulas for automatic refresh.  
4. **Analysis & Modeling** – Created Pivot Tables to summarize sales by bean type, region, and customer.  
5. **Visualization** – Designed interactive Pivot Charts, slicers, and timelines to explore trends.  
6. **Insights & Highlights** – Identified top customers, regional trends, and overall sales performance.
